                                        <p>When we first start to live alone, it’s worth having an open and honest conversation with those close to us about
                                            any
                                            early warning signs that our mental health is slipping, and what we’d like them to do if we’re having a bad
                                            mental
                                            health day.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

                <div class="mainContent">
            
                  <P>
                     Early warning signs might include things like isolating ourselves, ignoring people’s calls, giving up on meals and
                     living off cereal, or ditching any attempt at housework. None of these signs should come with any judgement. Sometimes
                     life happens and housework doesn’t. But learning to identify them can be a vital part of managing our mental health.
                                                                
                     Our communication could be as simple as texting a sentence or a particular GIF or emoji. We might want our loved ones to
                     respond by coming over and giving us a hug, asking their toddler to chat to us on the phone, or playing a video game
                     with us that evening.
                                                                
                     Once a system is set up, it’s far easier to let our loved ones know that we’re having a bad mental health day and to
                     know what we want them to do about it. We don’t have to explain, we don’t have to tell them what will help – they know,
                     because we’ve already discussed it.
                  </P>

                  <h1>1.BUILDING A SUPPORT SYSTEM</h1>

                  <p>When we live alone, a varied support system can be vital. It can take a little bit more ‘conscious building’ than if we
                live with family or friends.
                
                We all need emotional support. A friend we can call on a bad day, or a sibling who knows how to make us laugh.
                
                We might need practical support. Friends or family members who know about car mechanics, are good at DIY or have a knack
                for tracking down honest work (wo)men, can be invaluable. Sometimes it’s also helpful if we have someone who can do
                things like nip to the chemist and collect a prescription for us.
                
                For many of us, a sense of community can help us feel at home. Our location will affect how we build this community, but
                a good start is popping a note through our neighbours’ doors, to introduce ourselves.
                
                We might be fiercely independent, socially anxious, or have had our trust broken time after time. Maybe we’ve been
                forced to leave our entire life behind. Trusting people can be really hard. But none of us can function alone; we need
                people around us. Slowly piecing together our support system is a vital part of our self-care.</p>

                <h1>2. PRE-PROBLEM-SOLVING</h1>

                <p>Sometimes stuff goes wrong. We have a mental health crisis. Flu knocks us out, and we struggle to get out of bed. Our
                mood dips, our energy levels go with it, and doing the dishes becomes too much.
                
                Sitting down and thinking of these different situations that might occur, can help us to pre-problem-solve and plan.
                
                For example, we could keep a few ‘quick meals’ in for nights where the energy and/or motivation to cook has scarpered.
                Tins of beans, ready meals or even things like pot noodles can all be handy. If cooking is a struggle for us generally,
                then we could batch-cook to reduce how often we have to do it. Meal planning, and utilising short-cuts like pre-chopped
                vegetables, or microwave rice can be lifesavers.
                
                Having a few key items on our bedside table can make ‘can’t get out of bed‘ days a little easier. Cereal bars, a bottle
                of water, chewing gum and wet wipes can all help us to freshen up, and keep our strength up without having to move too
                far. It might be a good idea to pop a few phone numbers of people we can call there, too. This isn’t only helpful for
                bad mental health days, but can also be useful if we’re physically unwell.
                
                Shortcuts can allow us to keep going with the basics (like eating) during bad mental health patches. This could include
                things like using disposable crockery. Having a big water bottle so that we don’t have to keep getting up. Buying more
                socks so that we don’t have to do the washing so often. Or leaving our favourite snack various places around the house,
                so it’s ‘there’ when we’re hungry, and we don’t have to remember to grab it from the kitchen. These shortcuts aren’t
                always the most ethical options, but sometimes we have to do what we have to do to keep ourselves as healthy as
                possible.
                
                Pre-problem-solving can help us meet our basic needs, and keep things ticking over until we’re well enough to tackle
                other aspects of life again</p>

                <img src="images/img2.jpg" alt="">
                
                <h1>3. PLAN FOR A BAD DAY</h1>

                <p>Our pre-planning could involve a bad day plan. Something we can whip out and follow when our mood has dropped and we’re
                struggling.
                
                It could include things like a step-by-step list of our morning and evening routines (these can be tricky to remember
                when our brain is foggy). A list of things that help, such as changing into clothes or clean pyjamas, dragging ourselves
                out for a walk around the block, or doing some morning yoga can also help.
                
                When we live alone, we don’t have someone to prompt us or remind us of those things that help. We have to rely on
                past-us to do so. So having self-care prompts, reminders of the self-soothe strategies that help us, and reminders of
                those we can call are often really helpful.</p>

                <h1>4. LONELINESS</h1>

                <img src="images/img3.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Loneliness can be a biggy when we live alone. Though there is a problem with older people experiencing loneliness,
                statistically, the number of young people experiencing loneliness has overtaken the number of older people who are
                lonely.
                
                There are things we can do to reduce our likelihood of feeling lonely.
                
                Evening phone calls and/or video calls with friends or family can be great loneliness-busters.
                
                Adopting a pet needs to be done responsibly, and be inline with any rent contracts we’ve signed, but can be great for
                our mental health.
                
                Radios can create background noise, helping us to feel less isolated. Podcasts and TV shows are good, too. But the
                benefit of radio is that we can leave it on throughout our living space, removing the deafening silence that sometimes
                occurs. We can pop one radio in our bedroom and one in our kitchen, for example, and provided they all connect in the
                same way (eg. DAB), they should be in sync.
                
                Incidental interactions can help us to connect with our local area. For example, if we’re able to, doing our weekly food
                shop in person instead of online can create numerous incidental interactions; from a chat with a cashier to a quick
                conversation with a staff member who helps us find a specific product. If we get into a routine and shop at the same
                time each week, then we’ll often see the same people.
                
                Volunteering or joining local interest groups can get us out of our living space. They can also increase our sense of
                community.
                
                We don’t have to have loads of friends or go out every night to avoid loneliness. Some of us really value our own
                (quiet!) space. We might feel we have enough interactions and connections already. Some of us have busy jobs, and like
                quiet evenings. But if we are feeling lonely, then there are options out there of things we can do to try and reduce
                that loneliness.</p>

                         <p>By nigga <span class="bold">3 days ago</span></p>
                         <p>Alcohol is quite an embedded part of our culture, here in the UK. For some of us, it can be a social thing to do; we
                        might meet up with friends in bars or pubs, go on nights out and party until dawn, or have frequent dinner parties with
                        no shortage of wine. Others might have a glass of wine with their tea each night, a can or two whilst watching the
                        football, or a nice cool beverage whenever the sun shows itself.
                        
                        Whether alcohol is something we’ve grown up with, something we’ve discovered later on in life, something we have every
                        day, something we only touch occasionally, or something we watch others drink but don’t have personally, it’s worth
                        knowing how it can affect our mood</p>

                                <p>By Rodger <span class="bold">3 days ago</span></p>
                                <p>Sometimes we don’t want to talk. We don’t have anything to say, and even if we did, we wouldn’t know how to say it.
                                
                                Sometimes we need someone to sit with us so that we’re not alone, but we don’t want to talk. We might like to stick some
                                background noise on – film, TV, music, or radio. Do a jigsaw together. Play cards. Go on a drive. Watch wildlife. Or
                                just sit and watch the world go by.
                                
                                Take time to pause alongside us. Depression is lonely, and though there are times when we might want to be alone, often
                                the gaping black hole of loneliness can be as all-consuming as depression itself. Sitting alongside us helps to shrink
                                that gaping hole ever so slightly, giving us some respite.
                                
                                We don’t have to be talking to offer emotional support.</p>
